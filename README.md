# BlizzBot
# This is a Work In Progress.
BlizzBot is a Discord bot which provides information on World of Warcraft characters, guilds, etc.
There's already a lot of bots that does all that and more, way MORE, but I'm doing this as a starting project to learn how to program.

I will continue working on the bot to provide more information on other Blizzard games, more functionalities, etc.

BlizzBot uses Node.js, Modules: discord.js and blizzard.js
